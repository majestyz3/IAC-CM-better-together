# Terraform + Ansible + Packer + Vault Demo

## Overview
This demo showcases how to use **Terraform**, **Ansible Tower**, **HCP Packer**, and **HCP Vault** together to provision and configure:

- A **RHEL-based Linux EC2 instance**
- A **Windows EC2 instance** hosted on **Red Hat OpenShift**

All infrastructure is deployed using **HCP Terraform**, configured using **Ansible Tower**, secured with **HCP Vault**, and built from golden images maintained in **HCP Packer**.

## üîß Sub-Repositories

### 1. `iac-terraform-demo`
Contains all Terraform IaC files:
- AWS EC2 provisioning
- AMI lookups from HCP Packer
- Secrets pulled from HCP Vault

### 2. `packer-image-demo`
Builds hardened base images using:
- HCP Packer `amazon-ebs` builder
- Ansible provisioners for Linux and Windows

### 3. `cm-ansible-demo`
Ansible Tower playbooks and inventory:
- `linux.yml`, `windows.yml` for post-deploy config
- Terraform state-driven dynamic inventory
- Tower template config JSONs

## üîê Vault Secrets Required
Ensure the following secrets are stored in Vault KV:

- `kv/aws/creds`: `{ access_key, secret_key }`
- `kv/windows/admin`: `{ password }`

---

## üöÄ Launch Sequence

1. Run Packer builds:
   ```bash
   packer build linux.pkr.hcl
   packer build windows.pkr.hcl
   ```

2. Deploy Infra with Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init && terraform apply
   ```

3. Run Ansible playbooks via Tower:
   - Configure RHEL EC2
   - Configure Windows EC2

## üß† Notes
- RHEL image is based on official Red Hat AMIs (owner: `309956199498`)
- Windows image is Server 2022 (owner: `801119661308`)
- Ensure firewall and SSH/WinRM ports are open in your security group
- Make sure the SSH and WinRM credentials are injected via Vault and accessible to Tower
